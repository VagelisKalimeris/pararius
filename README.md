# Objective

Repeatedly applying to Pararius listings can be tiresome, especially typing or 
pasting your personal details. I implemented this quick & dirty Selenium script, 
automating this repetitive task.

# Instructions

### Selenium
If you haven't already, setup Selenium by following instructions 
[here](selenium_setup.md).

### Credentials
Go to **creds.json** file and enter your credentials. For example:

    {
      "message": "Hi, I am awesome!",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "johndoe@mail.com",
      "phone": "+99 99999999"
    }

### Execution
Run **apply.py** and enter your preferred listing's link on prompt.
